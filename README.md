## **Project Idea:** [Build Knowledge Base application on CHAOSS](https://github.com/chaoss/website/issues/708)

## Micro-task 1:

Research Knowledge Base plugins for WordPress

Best Plugins rankings according to my research  (I will update more plugins & change ranking in future [check here for comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MgODcFRB9EbVOF84Nf041RuOPRGTiimP_RMgNKJIlK0/edit?usp=sharing))

## Microtask 2:

Create a WordPress site. The site doesn't need to have real content but it should include dummy content (lorem ipsum...), navigation elements, and styling that complements the chaoss website.

## Microtask 3:

Implement two knowledgebase plugins (free versions) on your WordPress site. If you are recommending a plugin that costs money, please reach out to a mentor to discuss.

## Microtask 4:

Create a report to present the results of your micro-tasks and your proposal for implementing a knowledgebase on the CHAOSS website. Document the plugins and describe your design choices. Include links to your example implementations on your WordPress site.
